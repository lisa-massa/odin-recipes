    <h2>Description</h2>

    <p>I'm going to be honest. I usually hate chocolate. Well, that's an exaggeration - I dislike a lot of
        chocolate-<em>flavoured</em> things.
        Chocolate ice cream, chocolate cookies, chocolate waffles... Even most chocolate cakes! I never find that the
        chocolate flavour is forward enough.
    </p>
    <p>Because of my distaste for chocolate-flavoured treats, I really wanted to make a chocolate cake that was really
        chocolate-y.
        Kind of like a big brownie (with frosting!) I hope you enjoy this chocolate cake recipe as much as my family and
        I do.
    </p>
